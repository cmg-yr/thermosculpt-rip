            <strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You and <span>{{S1.name}}</span> agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and that any dispute between us relating to our web site, the services provided through our web site, any transaction or relationship between us resulting from your use of our web site, communications between us, or the purchase, order, or use of <span>{{S1.name}}</span> services and/or products, including disputes by either of us against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in interest, successor, or assign of the other, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration, except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and may seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and <span>{{S1.name}}</span> further agree that any determination regarding the applicability, enforceability, or validity of this arbitration agreement will be made by the arbitrator, not by any court.

            <strong>
                BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
            </strong>

            In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and conducted under AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules") then in effect at the time of the dispute.

            <strong>
                You may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by visiting the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879.
            </strong>

            If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. If you initiate arbitration, <span>{{S1.name}}</span> will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA's Procedures once you have notified <span>{{S1.name}}</span> in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if <span>{{S1.name}}</span>  is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to <span>{{S1.name}}</span>, including the filing fee.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims against <span>{{S1.name}}</span> and may not preside over any kind of representative or class proceeding against <span>{{S1.name}}</span>. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.

            <strong>
                YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST <span>{{S1.name}}</span> IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED A PRODUCT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND RETURN THE PRODUCT TO GET A REFUND, NOT USE THE PRODUCT OR WEB SITE, AND RETURN THE PRODUCT FOR A REFUND WITHIN 30 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST ORDER OF THE PRODUCT.
            </strong>

        <!--<strong>Credit Card Declines</strong>-->
        <!--<p>-->
        <!--    In the event a credit card transaction declines, after product has been shipped or received, and you have not exercised your cancellation rights per the terms and conditions, we reserve the right to reprocess the transaction in full. This includes the right to resubmit the charge on or about every two (2) days from the original declined transaction date and up to three (3) additional attempts thereafter.-->

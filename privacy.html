                We use cookies for your convenience. For example, we use
                session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate and otherwise use our
                Site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser
                on the user's hard drive. Cookies can be used to "remember" what information
                a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that
                Web Site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's
                transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move
                between and interact with Web pages and to complete commercial transactions
                over the Internet. The Site also uses cookies to store and sometimes track
                information to make your online experience easier and more personalized and for
                other purposes related to your use of the Site and related services. For
                example, because a cookie can be linked to information you have inputted or
                which has otherwise been collected, the need to repetitively enter certain
                information, such as your username or email address, can be eliminated. The use
                of cookies also assists us in acquiring important Site usage Data. Cookies can
                also assist us in tracking and targeting the interests, preferences and desires
                of our Site users to present the most appropriate messages, offers and other

                Currently, there are two general types of cookies commonly
                used in association with typical Web Sites including our Site:
                "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. A session or
                "session ID" cookie is functional only during the current
                "session" use of your browser, i.e., it ceases to function when you
                close you browser. A "persistent" cookie remains on your hard beyond
                the current browser session. You can remove persistent cookies by following
                directions provided in your Internet browser's "Help" file. We use

                Clear GIFs, otherwise known as "web beacons" or
                "single-pixel GIFs", are very small web page graphics that contain a
                unique digital identifying means. They function like cookies, in that they are
                often used to track and measure online actions taken by web site users. In
                contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear
                GIFs are embedded into the graphics, text or other components of Web pages,
                including pop up windows, or in other digital documents that can support them,
                like email messages. We may also use Web Beacons to optimize search engine
                functionality. Clear GIFs are nearly invisible and are often only the size of
                small dot, such as a period at the end of a sentence. Also, like cookies, Clear
                GIFs, help us and our Third Party Program Participants measure and improve Site
